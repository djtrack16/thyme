Computer science (or math) books (or papers) that I dip in and out of, like a cold bath.

Please **ONLY** use as a reference and actually **BUY THE BOOK** if you want to read it and really study it.
But yes it is really handy when  you need to find a particular string quick with CMD-F or CTRL-F (<ins>We all understand.</ins>)
